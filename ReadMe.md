# DMIT 2033 - Project 1

The design comp comes only in one size, you must come up with a plan for how
elements will layout on the smallest viewport. Do some sketches and have the layout
decisions for the smallest screen done before coding it. From that initial mobile layout
you will now make decisions in adjusting the layout and sizing of the elements until it
meets the larger layout provided to you in the PSD.
Following the layout practice and techniques taught in class, focus on creating an
intrinsic & fully assessable design. Each component of the page will need to adjust
when it best suits that component. The size of the columns and lines of text should be
carefully adjusted when contracting and expanding so that they maintain an optimal
length for readability.
You are required to write the CSS and HTML yourself, and extract the information you
need from the PSD and asset files provided. This design will require all the CSS layout
tools available to allow the content to expand and contract intelligently and with
purpose.
